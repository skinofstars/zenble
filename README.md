Albums thing in Zend 1.10

Bootstrapped using the http://phansible.com/

You will need VirtualBox, Vagrant and Ansible installed.

Simple as `vagrant up`


Zend latest actually has a github repo with a provisioning Vagranfile using puppet.
That said, initial impression is that's for developing the framework itself rather than project development.
Worth considering using it as a submodule though.
